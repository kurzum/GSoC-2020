# GSoC project proposal for Apache Camel.
Based on ["Create a component for Kafka-Stream"](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10652)

# About me¶
What relevant experience have you got, including university, work and hobby activities?
# Background¶
What exists already? What is the identified need? What can you reuse, what needs to he replaced?
Example: Apache Foo has already got support for HTTP client requests, but this does not work well with OAuth-based services. The main interface for requests can be reused, but this project proposes to replace the backend code with a modular approach based on Apache Bar.
# Design / description of work¶
Brief list of things you will do / create, in some rough chronological order.
Show which bits are essential, and which are optional. Highlight what is new, what are modifications, and how your work fits into the existing architecture.
Example:
Investigate REST client libraries
Develop JavaScript functions for browsing files (optional)
Integrate with Apache Foo's request system (essential)
# Results for the Apache community¶
Benefit of your work to Apache $Project users and developers. What will be the legacy of your work after you finish?
# Deliverables¶
Including milestones, components, documentation, tests.
# Scheduling¶
Not too detailed, but some milestones and checkpoints. Rough estimates per work item (weeks/days). Remember to leave time for slack and bugfixing!
# Other commitments¶
Exams, part time work, holidays, lectures.
# Community engagement¶
In particular with Apache $Project, including project mailing lists, wikis, issue trackers, test systems.
This should show a rough understanding of working with open source communities. You should be engaged with the rest of the community both before coding start (e.g. to develop this proposal) and during the project.
Include any planned user testing, prototypes, code review.
