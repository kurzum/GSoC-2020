# Background¶
Implementing several camel components:
- "Create a component for Kafka-Stream"(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10652)
- "Create a camel component for etcd v3"(https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CAMEL-10173)
# Design / description of work¶
Brief list of things you will do / create, in some rough chronological order.
Show which bits are essential, and which are optional. Highlight what is new, what are modifications, and how your work fits into the existing architecture.
Example:
Investigate REST client libraries
Develop JavaScript functions for browsing files (optional)
Integrate with Apache Foo's request system (essential)
# Results for the Apache community¶
 - Kafka-stream component
 - Etcd v3 component
# Deliverables¶
 - Kafka-stream component (Component, Endpoint, Consumer and Producer), tests, documentation (including examples), OSGi support
 - Etcd v3 component (Component, Endpoint, Consumer and Producer), tests, documentation (including examples), OSGi support
# Scheduling¶
Not too detailed, but some milestones and checkpoints. Rough estimates per work item (weeks/days). Remember to leave time for slack and bugfixing!
# Other commitments¶
Exams, part time work, holidays, lectures.
# Community engagement¶
In particular with Apache $Project, including project mailing lists, wikis, issue trackers, test systems.
This should show a rough understanding of working with open source communities. You should be engaged with the rest of the community both before coding start (e.g. to develop this proposal) and during the project.
Include any planned user testing, prototypes, code review.
