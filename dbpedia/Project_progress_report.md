# Initiation, community bonding period
We had two meetings with Sebastian and Aman. I've got better understanding of how databus works, and what should be done. 
We have also discussed organisational issues. I've been granted rights to the databus-maven-plugin repo, 
and given access to development server. Plan for this week is also to publish sample graph with the plugin.
