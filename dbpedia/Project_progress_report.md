# Initiation, community bonding period
We had two meetings with Sebastian and Aman. I've got better understanding of how databus works, and what should be done. 
We have also discussed organisational issues. I've been granted rights to the databus-maven-plugin repo, 
and given access to development server. Plan for this week is also to publish sample graph with the plugin.
# Week 1 (June 1 - June 7)
This week is not very productive as expected. I have finished work in Japan and had a flight on 2nd of June back to Germany. On 3rd I was setting everything up, this is going to continue for a few days more, but I will also work on the project (just not fulltime). Started reading the code of the databus-maven-plugin. Successfully built it. Read docs on how to develop maven plugins. Got better understanding of how it works. In general, looks very simple. Trying to publish my first dataset with the plugin. 
# Week 2 (June 8 - June 14)
