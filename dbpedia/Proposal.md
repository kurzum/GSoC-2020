# Project
"Combine DBpedia/Databus with Underlay" (https://forum.dbpedia.org/t/combine-dbpedia-databus-with-underlay/434)

Project Description:  
Integration of Underlay with Databus. Implement loading data to and from Underlay with Databus.  
If you would be willing and able to work on another of our suggested project ideas instead, which ones?  
Did not look into it.  
Please describe why you are interested in this specific project:  
The project is interesting because it potentially will deal with big amounts of data, and I love everything which is about performance. Scala is a big plus too.  
Please describe a tentative project architecture or an approach to it:  
Two main components:
 - databus-maven-plugin - for publishing the data by customers
 - databus-client - loads published data, SPARQL endpoint
 
 
Please detail an expected project plan and timeline with milestones:  
Tasks in order:
- look in more details in the project code (both plugin and client), get better understanding how it works (1-2 weeks)
- investigate on Underlay (data formats, api, libraries they provide) (1 week)
- make initial design of the integration (2-3 days)
Milestone 1.
- implement uploading part, with unit tests (1-3 weeks, difficult to assess)
- implement downloading part, with unit tests (1-3 weeks, difficult to assess)
Milestone 2.
- testing on some real data + integration (1-2 weeks)
- documentation (1 week)
- spare time for bugfixes and unexpected obstacles (2 weeks)

<!--Please include in your plan how will you evaluate the performance of your contribution (in terms of time, or accuracy, or both), as well as which data sets you will use for that evaluation.-->
# Technical skills

Worked as a developer in industry. 3-4 years of experience in Java and 3-4 years more in Scala. Basic Python, Javascript, web-development.  
Oracle Certified Professional (Java 8).  
See example of code in "Open source" section.

# Open Source

Contributed and continue to several opensource projects: akka (latest big PR: https://github.com/akka/akka/pull/26825), akka-http; small contributions to Apache JMeter, neosemantics, java-stix, swagger-akka-http.  
Why opensource? Firstly, opensource  helps you to grow as a professional, you can learn best practices and get inspiration for your projects from opensource. Secondly, sometimes I contribute to projects I use in my work, when its needed. Thirdly, its fun.

# Background & education

University of Freiburg. MS Computer Science. 2018 - now

# Research

Didn't do much research. Had small project on investigating Neo4j performance on full Wikidata database imported in it (no publication). Cannot name any interesting paper.  
I would be interested in co-authoring a paper, if any.

# Summer plans

I will be in Russia and Germany. First two weeks of the project will not be very active, because will be finishing my internship in NII (Japan). After the intenship - full dedication (30-40 hours per week).

# GSoC Experience

Did not participate in GSoC before.  
Have you applied or do you plan to apply for any other 2017 Summer of Code projects? Thinking about it.  
Why GSoC? Great opportunity to learn more, get new aquaintances with great programmers, potentially find a job, contribute to opensource and to earn some money.  
Why DBpedia? Two reasons: 
 - I worked a little with rdf/ttl before, and it may be useful here
 - I love Scala, and its only project which is in Scala
 
# And finally...

Why me?
 - I think I can do a good job.
 - I love Scala.
